# LSTM Dynamical Systems Reconstruction
In this project LSTMs are used to reconstruct and predict trajectories of dynamical systems.

There are two datasets in the data folder: i) Lorenz system  ii) Lorenz96 system

The trained models for both systems can be found in the models folder.

Additionally a power spectrum correlation can be calculated using the notbook in the PSC folder.
